# Course Enrollment Testing Guide

## Overview
The course enrollment system has been implemented and is now fully functional. Users can enroll in courses through a payment flow that simulates real payment processing.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Missing Enrollment API Endpoints**
- Created `/api/user/enroll` - Handles course enrollment
- Created `/api/user/enrolled-courses` - Fetches user's enrolled courses

### 2. **Payment Modal Integration**
- Updated `PaymentModal` component to actually enroll users after payment
- Added enrollment success callback handling
- Integrated with the enrollment API

### 3. **Course Display Updates**
- Added `originalPrice` field to courses for discount display
- Updated courses API to include pricing information
- Fixed type mismatches between components

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- Dashboard now fetches actual enrolled courses from the API
- Shows real enrollment data instead of dummy data

## How to Test

### 1. **Setup Database and Sample Data**
```bash
# Setup database schema
npm run db:setup

# Add sample courses
npm run db:add-courses
```

### 2. **Test Enrollment Flow**
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/courses` page
3. Click "Enroll Now" on any course
4. If not signed in, you'll be prompted to sign in
5. After signing in, the payment modal will open
6. Fill in payment details (any data works for demo)
7. Click "Pay Now" - this will simulate payment and enroll you
8. Check your dashboard to see the enrolled course

### 3. **Verify Enrollment**
- Go to `/dashboard` to see your enrolled courses
- The course should appear in the "Enrolled Courses" section
- Course progress and video counts should be displayed

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- `user_courses` table tracks enrollments
- `user_video_progress` table tracks video completion
- Proper foreign key relationships ensure data integrity

### API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/user/enroll` - Enrolls user in a course
- **GET** `/api/user/enrolled-courses?userId={id}` - Gets user's courses

### Authentication
- Currently uses localStorage for demo purposes
- In production, integrate with proper auth system (JWT, sessions, etc.)

## Demo Credentials
- **Admin User**: `admin@thelasttrade.com` / `superadmin123`
- **Regular User**: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`

## Sample Courses Available
1. **Stock Trading Fundamentals** - ₹999 (Beginner)
2. **Technical Analysis Mastery** - ₹1,499 (Intermediate)
3. **Risk Management Strategies** - ₹1,299 (Intermediate)
4. **Advanced Trading Strategies** - ₹1,999 (Advanced)

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Real Payment Gateway**: Integrate with Razorpay or similar
2. **User Authentication**: Implement proper JWT/session-based auth
3. **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails on enrollment
4. **Course Access Control**: Implement proper course content access
5. **Progress Tracking**: Add video progress tracking functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Failed to fetch courses"** - Check database connection
2. **"User ID is required"** - Ensure user is authenticated
3. **"Course not found"** - Verify sample courses were added

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test database connection
npm run db:test

# Check database tables
psql -d your_database -c "\dt"
```

The enrollment system is now fully functional and ready for testing!

## Admin Panel Testing

### Enrolled Courses Count
To test the enrolled courses count in the admin panel:

1. **Add Sample Enrollments**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:add-enrollments
   ```

2. **Navigate to Admin Panel**: Go to `/admin` page
3. **Switch to User Management**: Click on "User Management" tab
4. **Verify Statistics**: You should see:
   - Total Users count
   - Total Enrollments count
   - Active Students count (users with enrollments)
5. **Check User Cards**: Each user should show their enrolled courses count as a blue badge

### What You'll See
- **User Statistics Cards**: Three cards showing total users, total enrollments, and active students
- **Enrolled Courses Badge**: Blue badge on each user card showing their course count
- **Real-time Updates**: Counts update automatically when enrollments change

### Admin Panel Features
- **User Management**: View all users with their enrollment counts
- **Course Management**: Manage courses and their content
- **Video Management**: Edit and organize course videos
- **Real-time Statistics**: See enrollment trends and user activity
