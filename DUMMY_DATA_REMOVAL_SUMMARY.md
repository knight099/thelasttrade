- Added TODO items for API implementation
- Added security notes for admin credentials

## What This Means

### For Development:
- The application now shows proper empty states instead of fake data
- All components are ready for real API integration
- Clear TODO comments indicate what needs to be implemented
- Better user experience with meaningful empty states

### For Production:
- No more fake data that could confuse users
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Security improvements for admin credentials
- Clean codebase ready for real data

## Next Steps

To complete the transition from dummy data to real functionality:

1. **Implement API endpoints:**
   - `/api/courses` - Fetch available courses
   - `/api/user/enrolled-courses` - Fetch user's enrolled courses
   - `/api/courses/[id]` - Fetch specific course details
   - `/api/courses/[id]/videos` - Fetch course videos
   - `/api/admin/courses` - Admin course management
   - `/api/admin/videos` - Admin video management

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY` for payment integration
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` for admin user
   - `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` for super admin

3. **Connect to real data sources:**
   - Database queries for courses and videos
   - User enrollment tracking
   - Progress tracking system

4. **Test empty states:**
   - Verify all empty states display correctly
   - Test user flows when no data is available
   - Ensure proper error handling

## Benefits of This Change

- **Better UX:** Users see meaningful empty states instead of confusing fake data
- **Cleaner Code:** No more hardcoded arrays cluttering components
- **Production Ready:** Application is ready for real data integration
- **Maintainable:** Clear separation between UI and data logic
- **Professional:** No more placeholder content that looks unprofessional
